# Note-Taker

## Description 
This challenge we were asked to make a note taker that will be able to save notes until you would like to delete them. This project was nice to work on to keep practicing with node.js.

## Installation
The part of this project that needed to be installed was the server side javascripts. The first part that was worked on was the server.js which was easy first I set up the node js packages and the middleware needed. Next I set up the routes to note and api and lastly tset up the port. next I worked on the db.js file that would retrieve save notes, save new notes, and delete notes from the notes html page. I decided to set up my db.js like the mini project and make a helpers files containing the fs and utils node packages instead of adding it to the db.js. The last thing I did was figure out how to delete the notes from the page and the db.json file.

## Usage 
Once the page is opened they are presented with a get started button. Once that button is pushed they are taken to the notes page, where on the left they are presented with past saved notes where they can click on the note and see it opened on the page or they can delete the note by clicking the red trash can icon. To the right on the saved notes list there is an option to add a note title and a note description once the desciption is added a save note button appears to save the note to the list.
